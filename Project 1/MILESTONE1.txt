Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.


1.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the empty Sudoku board.  (You should
only comment out one line and uncomment one line to do that.)
Then change the delay in the usleep delay in the solvePuzzle function
to 100000.  What solution do you get?

After 82 steps we get:

STEP 82:
 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
 6 5 4 3 2 1 9 8 7
 3 2 1 9 8 7 6 5 4
 8 9 6 7 4 5 2 1 3
 7 4 5 2 1 3 8 9 6
 2 1 3 8 9 6 7 4 5
 5 7 9 4 6 8 1 3 2
 4 6 8 1 3 2 5 7 9
 1 3 2 5 7 9 4 6 8

TODO:

2.  Edit solve.cpp to solve the MazeRunner problem, and set the code
to declare activeStates as ArrayStack or LinkedListStack.
Do you see why it's called depth-first search (DFS)?
How many steps long was the solution it found?
64

TODO: 

3.  Next, edit solve.cpp again to switch to make activeStates
a VectorPriorityQueue.  This gives you best-first search (BestFS).
How many steps long was the solution it found?
58

TODO:

4.  Edit solve.cpp to switch to the 3x3 slider puzzle.  Also,
comment out the delay and print statements in the solvePuzzle function.
How long does it take to solve this problem with BestFS (using
VectorPriorityQueue as in the preceding question)?
1 second and 59 steps

TODO:

5.  Edit solve.cpp to switch back to ArrayStack or LinkedListStack,
which switches back to DFS.  Try solving the 3x3 slider puzzle.
What happens?  Why?
It takes much to long to solve more than half an hour.  This is because how the DFS works is not useful in this case because it takes a very long time.
